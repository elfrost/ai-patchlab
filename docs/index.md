# AI PatchLab Scans

Security scans of public repositories run with
[AI PatchLab](https://github.com/elfrost/ai-patchlab), an open-source,
local-first security scanner.

Every report on this page was generated locally. No source code was sent to
any third party, no AI provider was contacted, and no paid API was called.
AI PatchLab orchestrates [Semgrep](https://semgrep.dev),
[Gitleaks](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks),
[Trivy](https://trivy.dev), and
[pip-audit](https://github.com/pypa/pip-audit), then applies deterministic
remediation and confidence rules to normalize the findings.

## How these scans work

- Each scan targets a public repository at a specific commit.
- Findings are curated: noise filtered out, top items highlighted.
- Critical issues are reported to maintainers under responsible disclosure
  before being published here in full detail.
- Posts focus on patterns and lessons — not exploit walkthroughs.

## Scans

- **2026-05-14** — [gptme/gptme](scans/gptme-gptme.html) — 57 findings, 3 best-practice improvements filed with the maintainer

## About AI PatchLab

AI PatchLab is a Python CLI that produces JSON and Markdown security reports
from a local repository path. It is designed for engineers and maintainers
who want a real audit without sending their codebase to a cloud service.

- Source: [github.com/elfrost/ai-patchlab](https://github.com/elfrost/ai-patchlab)
- Built on top of Semgrep, Gitleaks, Trivy, and pip-audit
- AI review is disabled by default and local-first when opted in

For setup and full documentation, see the project
[README](https://github.com/elfrost/ai-patchlab#readme).
